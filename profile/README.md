# Digital Governance Council

## What We Do

The Digital Governance Council (formerly the CIO Strategy Council) works through its members across the public and private sectors to strengthen trust in Canada’s digital economy by collaboratively identifying, prioritizing and acting on digital governance opportunities and challenges.  

The Digital Governance Council is Canada’s only national body for delivering a coordinated national approach to digital governance.

## Executive Forum

The  Executive Forum provides a neutral environment for Canadian executives to engage in dialogue, learn, share and advance digital governance to inform, innovate and act. 

## Digital Governance Standards Institute

The Digital Governance Standards Institute, accredited by the Standards Council of Canada to develop national standards for Canada, works through volunteers, experts and partners to develop national digital governance standards.
					
## Certification

The Council assesses and certifies the compliance of organizations with the digital governance standards developed by the Digital Governance Standards Institute. Certification by the Council is a mark of trust for Canadians and organizations everywhere.
